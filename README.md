## Why?

Why not? It is cool hosting your own server on your own device. ðŸ˜Ž
## Requirements

- [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases)
- [AnLinux](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=exa.lnx.a&hl=en&gl=US)
- Atleast 3GB of Ram available (not talking about your total RAM)
- Good CPU i guess, cause lags sucks, just more than 1.5ghz is enough

### Install Ubuntu on your Android Device

Open Anlinux

## FAQ

#### How can I allocate more memory?

Answer: If you want to use more memory, simply multiply 1024 by 2 if you want 2GB, or 3 if you want 3GB. And edit startup command like this:

Example:
```bash
java -Xmx1024M -Xms3072M -jar server.jar nogui
```
But using much ram your device cannot handle might crash your server. For safer procedure, divide your available RAM by 2 and use that instead :)
